# Example: volume workspace, three WorkItems, `/workspace` stays

Builds on
[00-one-workload-default-target.md](00-one-workload-default-target.md).
Same Cluster, same default ExecutionTarget. AO shares one **workspace**
volume across three successive WorkItems. Each container mounts it at
`/workspace`. Files written by an earlier WorkItem are still there for
the next.

This is the volume path. [Example 03](03-data-sharing-with-workspace-object-store.md)
is the **same three WorkItems** (git clone, HTTP GET, playbook) but
the workspace is an S3 snapshot instead of a PVC, so B can run on
another cluster.

AO creates the workspace with a dedicated API call, then submits
WorkItems that cite that id. WorkItem A places with empty selectors
([default routing](../executiontarget-reconciler.md#default-routing)).
After EP provisions the volume on `ep-default`, B and C **reuse**
that UUID. That reuse is a **placement constraint**: they run on
`ep-default` because that is the ExecutionTarget associated with the
workspace.

## What this example is

A concrete inventory of a **volume-based workspace** (Kubernetes PVC
on this target).

The three WorkItems run **one at a time**. That is the default
access mode (`rw`): a ReadWriteOnce volume cannot have a second
writable mount. After each exits, the Worker Manager unmounts. The
volume is not deleted. The next WorkItem mounts the same UUID and
sees the same tree.

`ro` (read-only, parallel OK) and `copy` (private clone, parallel OK,
writes discarded) are in [data-sharing-with-workspace.md](../data-sharing-with-workspace.md). This
example stays on successive `rw` to keep the payload simple.

```text
workspace id 7c1a9f3e-4b2d-41a8-9c1f-91c0d4e5a6b7
                          →  volume on ExecutionTarget ep-default
                          →  mounted at /workspace

AO execution
  WorkItem A  git-clone         →  writes /workspace/src
  WorkItem B  http-request      →  writes /workspace/site.yml
                               →  /workspace/src is still there
  WorkItem C  ansible-playbook  →  reads /workspace/src and site.yml
                               →  writes /workspace/out/report.json
```

## Workspace create

AO mints the UUID and **creates** the workspace with a dedicated EP
API call **before** any WorkItem. A good default is **one workspace
per workflow**: AO generates the id when the run starts, `POST`s it,
and puts the same id on every WorkItem that should see the files
(here A, B, and C). Making the workspace optional is an AO / UX
problem. EP does not look at `activity.params` to guess which
WorkItems share a folder.

```http
POST /workspaces
```

```json
{
  "id": "7c1a9f3e-4b2d-41a8-9c1f-91c0d4e5a6b7"
}
```

EP refuses a duplicate id. A WorkItem that cites an unknown UUID
fails. Submitting A, B, or C does **not** create a workspace.

The `POST` does **not** create the volume. AO does not know the
ExecutionTarget yet, and it does not pass a target.

On every WorkItem, EP **looks up** the UUID. For A the workspace
exists and no volume is attached yet: after A is matched and
**before** it is dispatched, EP provisions the volume on that
ExecutionTarget. Size is the ExecutionTarget default.

WorkItems B and C carry the **same** UUID. Lookup finds the volume
already provisioned for A. That is reuse, not a second create and
not a rejection. Reuse pins B and C to `ep-default`, the
ExecutionTarget that already holds that volume.

The WorkItems carry the UUID, not a PVC name.

## Incoming WorkItems

### WorkItem A — clone into `/workspace`

```json
{
  "selectors": {},
  "payload": {
    "activity": {
      "image": "registry.redhat.io/ao/git-clone:1.0.0",
      "params": {
        "uri": "git+https://gitlab.example.com/org/playbooks.git",
        "ref": "a1b2c3d4e5f6",
        "dest": "/workspace/src"
      }
    },
    "data": {
      "workspace": "7c1a9f3e-4b2d-41a8-9c1f-91c0d4e5a6b7"
    }
  }
}
```

### WorkItem B — download beside the clone

```json
{
  "selectors": {},
  "payload": {
    "activity": {
      "image": "registry.redhat.io/ao/http-request:1.0.0",
      "params": {
        "url": "https://files.example.com/files/abc123/site.yml",
        "dest": "/workspace/site.yml"
      }
    },
    "data": {
      "workspace": "7c1a9f3e-4b2d-41a8-9c1f-91c0d4e5a6b7"
    }
  }
}
```

B does not re-clone. `/workspace/src` is already on the volume from A.

### WorkItem C — playbook using both files

```json
{
  "selectors": {},
  "payload": {
    "activity": {
      "image": "registry.redhat.io/ao/ansible-playbook:1.0.0",
      "params": {
        "playbook": "/workspace/src/site.yml",
        "extra_vars_file": "/workspace/site.yml"
      }
    },
    "data": {
      "workspace": "7c1a9f3e-4b2d-41a8-9c1f-91c0d4e5a6b7"
    }
  }
}
```

C does not fetch. It reads what A and B left under `/workspace` and
writes `/workspace/out/report.json`.

`/workspace` is the **default mount** for every Extension in this
example. Paths in `activity.params` (`dest`, `playbook`,
`extra_vars_file`) are absolute paths on that mount, not relative
paths rewritten by an SDK helper. If this contract is accepted,
coordinate with
[ANSTRAT-2422](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/ANSTRAT-2422) so
Git, HTTP, playbook, and other images document the same location.

| Field | Meaning for EP |
|---|---|
| `selectors` | Used for **A** (empty → default routing). For B and C they are still checked against the **pinned** target; they cannot pick a different one. |
| `payload.activity.image` | Container image. Git, HTTP, and playbook are ordinary WorkItems. |
| `payload.activity.params` | Owned by that activity. `dest` / playbook paths under `/workspace` are the activity's. |
| `payload.data.workspace` | Workspace UUID. Must already exist (`POST`). Unknown id fails the WorkItem. After a volume exists: placement constraint to the ExecutionTarget that holds it. |

There is no `data.inputs` list and no `payload.volume_mounts`.

## Registered Cluster and default ExecutionTarget

Same inventory as [example 00](00-one-workload-default-target.md).

```yaml
cluster:
  name: local-openshift
  cluster_type: openshift
  endpoint: https://api.cluster.local:6443
  status: active
  enabled: true
  labels:
    cluster: local-openshift
```

```yaml
# Illustrative keys only. Names such as endpoint, namespace, and labels
# are for readability and are not the final field design.
execution_target:
  name: ep-default
  cluster: local-openshift
  namespace: ao-execution
  backend_type: k8s
  endpoint: https://api.cluster.local:6443
  is_default: true
  status: active
  enabled: true
  labels: {}
```

The workspace volume lives on this target after A runs. Effective
labels for matching A are still only `{ cluster: local-openshift }`.
The workspace id is **not** a label and does not override labels.

For B and C the volume pin is the eligible set: only this
ExecutionTarget. EP does not call the reconciler to find another
place. B's selectors still have to match **this** target's effective
labels. In this example they are empty, so they pass.

If B required an environment A did not land on — for example
`selectors.env=production` while `ep-default` has no `env` label — B
fails (`NO_MATCHING_TARGETS`). The error explains the constraint: the
volume is on `ep-default`, and that target does not advertise `env`.
EP does not move the volume to a production namespace and does not
ignore B's selectors. WorkItems that must run on different targets
share an
[object-store workspace](03-data-sharing-with-workspace-object-store.md),
not a volume.

## What is on `/workspace`

The directory outlives each container. Only the mount comes and goes.

| After | `/workspace` contains |
|---|---|
| WorkItem A exits | `src/` (clone of the pinned SHA) |
| WorkItem B exits | `src/` **and** `site.yml` |
| WorkItem C exits | `src/`, `site.yml`, **and** `out/report.json` |

If AO submits a fourth WorkItem with the same UUID, that tree is still
there until AO `DELETE`s it. TTL is only a safety net if nobody
DELETEs.

Parallel branches and loops are AO's graph, not EP's. For this
volume, a second `rw` WorkItem waits until the first unmounts. To
overlap, AO would set `access` to `ro` or `copy` (see
[data-sharing-with-workspace.md](../data-sharing-with-workspace.md)); this example does not.

## What EP does

**WorkItem A** (workspace exists, no volume yet):

1. **Claim.** The Work Scheduler picks up the WorkItem from the Work
   Store.
2. **Lookup.** The UUID already exists from AO's `POST`. An unknown
   id would fail the WorkItem.
3. **Reconcile.** `selectors: {}` takes default routing. Eligible set
   `{ep-default}`. The reconciler does not read `data.workspace`.
4. **Provision.** The Work Scheduler now has an ExecutionTarget. It
   provisions the volume on `ep-default` before dispatch.
5. **Dispatch.** The Work Scheduler sends the work to the Kubernetes
   Worker Manager for `ep-default`.
6. **Run.** That Worker Manager mounts workspace
   `7c1a9f3e-4b2d-41a8-9c1f-91c0d4e5a6b7` at `/workspace` and
   cold-starts a pod from `payload.activity.image`. On exit it
   unmounts. It does not delete the volume.

**WorkItems B and C** (reuse):

1. **Claim.** The Work Scheduler picks up the WorkItem from the Work
   Store.
2. **Pin.** The UUID already has a volume on `ep-default`. That is the
   **only** candidate. The Work Scheduler does not ask the reconciler
   for a different target.
3. **Check selectors.** B's selectors must still match `ep-default`.
   Empty selectors pass. A miss (B asked for an environment this
   target does not advertise) is `NO_MATCHING_TARGETS`; the error
   explains that the volume pin is the constraint. The work fails.
   It waits until no other WorkItem holds this UUID
   (ReadWriteOnce).
4. **Dispatch.** Same Worker Manager for `ep-default`.
5. **Run.** Same mount at `/workspace`. On exit, unmount. The volume
   stays.
